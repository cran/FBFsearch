Description: We propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching the space
 of Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. The algorithm uses moment
 fractional Bayes factors (MFBF) and is suitable for learning sparse graphs.
 The algorithm is implemented using Armadillo, an open-source C++ linear
 algebra library.
